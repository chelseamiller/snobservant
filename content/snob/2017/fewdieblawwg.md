Ridiculously QUICK and EASY recipe for a POSITIVELY VIRAL cooking blog!

Written by BreeJesusOnCrackers

There are few indulgences better in life than a platter of caviar and creme fraiche tartlets. Among them is the platter of caviar and creme fraiche tartlets that you purchased with your blog’s PPC ad earnings.  Mmm...that clump of chive tasted just like an auto-play video ad of horsemoosebutt detox supplements that doctors hate. The stoneground wheat cracker could use a little more Adblocker guilt-tripping, however.  
I digress.  We could all use a bit more traffic to our sites (and a little less on our commutes from work to our fave Whole Foods, please!).  So, I’m delighted to present an absolutely foolproof, impossible-to-fudge-up (unless that’s on the menu!) formula to you beautifully busy moms!  It’s SO incredibly quick and easy, an unreleased prisoner from Plato’s cave could do it!
We’re all so busy being amazing and badass mamas that I’m going to jump right into it.  Just like with a vegan paleo souffle, every second counts!  I warn you, this recipe is absolutely ahh-ddicting!  Once I honed this baby and shared it with my husband and his inlaws and his inlaws’ inlaws and his inlaws’ inlaws’ husbands and my husband’s inlaws’ lawyers at our little autumn pumpkin spice casual get-together, they couldn’t get enough and won’t stop begging for more!

As a matter of fact, the quaint New Brunswick sea-front vacation cottage passed down from my maternal great grandparents to us is the exact manger of this magic. With the nestled tangle of blue lillies and wild bugleweed, this humble 19th century contemporary abode was the focal point of many-a-hush-hush secret recipes circulated all around within our family reunions.

I especially remember one secret recipe for lingonberry-infused borscht that was the topic of hot debate during a babyshower one balmy May afternoon.  The recipe, as written, called for a garnish of truffle shavings.  This was a very old recipe lovingly passed down many moons ago from the late great great great aunt three times removed, so we were tasked with the challenge of determining whether the recipe called for chocolate truffles or fruiting body truffles.  My husband’s cousin led Team Chocolate, insisting that only cacao would punctuate the high notes of berries grown in high latitudes.  Meanwhile, my mother’s brother’s only niece crusaded the argument that only the meaty texture of mushroom truffles would facilitate the mellowing of the baby heirloom beet reduction.  Even my cat sitter’s gardener had something to say!  It was utter catophony, and the most passionate family feud I’ve ever bore witness to!  To settle this matter, we all needed to broaden our mental horizons and relive our trip to the exquisite beaches laid upon the gulf of gorgeous Thailand!
Ahh, Thailand.  Not a day goes by that I don’t relive the transformation brought upon by the volcanic black sand rock shores, the most adorably hospitable locals who were so incredibly welcoming with broad smiles at all times, and fresh-pierced young coconut water straight out the husk!  The sweet fish vendor graciously opened his home to me for a authentic sea-to-plate meal.  Never will I forget the joy in his smiling eyes as he navigated on his motorbike through the thrilling chaotic streets to his hillside thatch hut.

It was there that I was graciously fed an assortment of offerings from the Mekong River, gently braised over an open charcoal fire.  It was SUCH an adventure!  I worked up the courage to taste the fresh carp belly, which simply melted onto my palate, and made me feel like a total diet cheater!  It’s no wonder the locals are all so fit and trim!  They’ve got macronutrients and flavour figured out to an art form!
It was this complex flavour profile that inspired daydreams of my travels all throughout coastal France, where truffle was always featured on the menu.  And only that ingredient could possibly make the understated earthy flavours of beet dance.  Mushroom wins to cacao 1-0.  And I concede this as a card-carrying chocoholic! 
So how can we design our recipe blogs to be just as multifaceted and complex?  How can we stoke readers’ voracious appetite for the meat of the content?  And although we want our recipes to be YOUnique, how do we achieve that without being too out-there?

I got you, fam.

As with any edible recipe, it’s taken many iterations of variations and accumulations of coffee cups at my writing station, but I finally happened upon the one!  Yep, that’s right -- it’s “put a ring on it” perfect.

Author: BreeJesusOnCrackers
Prep time: 5-25 min
Cook time: 2
Serves: 1 family reunion

Ingredients:
- 1 punny and not funny blog name
- 10 matcha latte’s worth of overenthusiasm
- At least 1 generous greasing of opportunity to brag about your exotic travels, recycled from your previously publicized “finding yourself” campaign
- 4-5 sprigs of last year’s millennial slang, just to demonstrate how ‘quirky’ and young-at-heart you are
- 1 antique teacup’s amount of rosy family memories of bygone years
- 19 or more different hard-to-find spices sprinkled throughout the list. This helps boost the odds that your reader will be annoyed to discover that they’ll NEVER have enough spices in their overflowing spice rack.
- 1 make-or-break ingredient that can only be harvested 0.21 full moons after the Goddess cries in tiny corner of a secret rainforest that only a certain country’s tribe know the whereabouts of.  But, if you’re just unable to manage that, then I guess you can reluctantly substitute with some sad, mundane ingredient suggestion. It won’t be the same though, but, you know. Gotta work with what you have!
- 1 forced smile and the writing tone that would be associated with it.
- Condescendingly specific types of ingredients. No, store bought brown sugar just doesn’t caramelize the same way.  Go get the real organic raw brown sugar, it’s totally worth the extra $14
- 10 affiliate links that conveniently allow your reader to purchase that REAL brown sugar online.
- 1 entire department store’s selection of appliances, plus at least one appliance that can only be ordered off of some sketchy site promoting life extension water
- A steady remouillage of unnecessarily flowery culinary terms, ideally used incorrectly.
- Served on a stale humblebrag of your own culinary skills and productivity by constant emphasis of how EASY the dish is for you, as a such a LAZY cook and BUSY mother!
- Garnish with obnoxiously all-caps words
- Follow with a comments section so that you can be flattered by impressed readers who wish to impress their relatives at their impressively nuclear family reunions.
